  Our project is a basic edition of the multiplayer game, Monopoly. Our project 
  launches an interactive window, allowing each player to throw a die, can move 
  spaces, buy property, pay and collect rent, go to and get out of jail, or quit
  the game on their turn.  Players can view the Monopoly board, their movement,
  bank accounts, properties owned, and general state of the game.
